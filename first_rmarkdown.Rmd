## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

Adding some texts.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

An example of an R chunk.

```{r cars}
answer <- 7 / 9 + sin(2)

#1num <- 2
#text^me <- "Chester"
#happy! <- "Very happy"
Name <- "Billy"
name <- "Bernie"
nAme <- "Barack"

?sum
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
