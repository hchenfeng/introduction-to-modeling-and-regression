```

## Simulate a Simple Linear Regression

```{r simulate}
x = seq(from = 0, to = 4, by = .1)
error = rnorm(length(x), mean = 0, sd = 3.9)
y = 30 + 10 * x + error
mean(x)
sd(error)
sd(y)
```

## Plot X and Y

```{r simulate-plot}
plot(x, y)
```
## Fit a Simple Regression Model
```{r}
fitmodel = lm(y ~ x)
fitmodel
```

## To get more information about the model
```{r}
summary(fitmodel)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
